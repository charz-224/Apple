        <main>Apples are juicy because they are composed of up to 85% water held within their cells. When you bite into a fresh apple, the cell walls rupture, releasing this liquid, which is a combination of water and sugar. This liquid is contained in vacuoles, which are like tiny, pressurized water balloons inside the cells.</main>
