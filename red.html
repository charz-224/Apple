        <main>Apples are red because of a pigment called anthocyanin, which develops as the fruit ripens, especially with sun exposure. The pigments absorb other colors of light while reflecting red light, which is what our eyes perceive. Environmental factors like sunlight and temperature play a significant role in the production of this pigment.</main>
